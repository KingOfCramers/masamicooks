Cucumbers are a peak summer food. When it's simply too hot and you can't bear to cook, crisp and refreshing cucumbers are here for you. Turned into a simple salad, your summer saving grace becomes more than just a single vegetable chopped up on a plate. This basic recipe can be riffed on in a multitude of ways - different herbs like mint or parsley add flair as does swapping the vinegar for lemon juice. 

## Ingredients

- 1/2 hothouse cucumber or 2 Persian cucumbers
- 2 tsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 T cilantro, chopped
- 1/2 tsp sesame seeds

## Instructions

Cut the cucumbers into 2 inch chunks. On a cutting board, use the back of a frying pan to smash the cucumbers into bite sizes pieces.\
\
In a small bowl, combine the mashed cucumbers with vinegar, sugar, salt and all but a pinch of the cilantro. Using your hands, gently toss to combine until you feel the sugar and salt dissolve, about 2 mins. \
\
Allow cucumbers to marinate for 5 mins.\
\
To serve, top with remaining cilantro and sesame seeds.\
