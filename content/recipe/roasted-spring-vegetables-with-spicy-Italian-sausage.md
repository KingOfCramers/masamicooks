Replace the sausage with a vegan variety and voila! It's vegan!

## Ingredients

- 3/4 lb thin skinned potatoes such as red, purple, or white potatoes cut into bite sized pieces
- 1 small red onion
- 1/3 C olive oil
- 1/4 C white wine vinegar
- 3 zucchini or yellow summer squash, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 lb green beans, trimmed
- 1/4 C olive oil
- 1 lb spicy Italian sausages
- Parsley, chopped
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, combine potatoes, onions, 1/4 C olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Use your hands to gently mix and spread into an even layer.\
\
Bake potato and onion mixture for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the other vegetables.\
\
After 20 minutes, remove the potato mixture from the oven. Add vinegar, summer squash, cherry tomatoes, green beans, 1/4 C olive oil, salt and pepper to the pan. Gently toss using a spatula and spread into an even layer. Place the sausages on top of the mixture and return to the oven for 30 minutes.\
\
After 30 minutes, remove the pan from the oven and set the sausages aside. Begin preheating the broiler.\
\
Using a spatula, stir the vegetable mixture. Return the veggies to the oven and broil for 5 minutes. Repeat this process 2-3 times until veggies have achieved a slight crisp and are browned at the edges. Serve topped with parsley.\
