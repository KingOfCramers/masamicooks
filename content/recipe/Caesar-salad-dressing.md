Caesar is the gateway drug to the world of salads. She's creamy and cheesy, enabling even the pickiest of eaters to try and delight in green vegetables. A true standby, Caesar never lets me down when I'm feeling more like "cheese for dinner" and I know veggies are probably the better choice. We all know Caesar's dressing is what steals the show, and it really can go with anything, which is why it's all I've provided here (you can add the romaine and salmon yourself, if you so choose!) My version is far from traditional - it doesn't contain raw egg and it comes together in minutes in a blender. 

## Ingredients
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1 1/2 T mayonnaise
- 2 tsp dijon mustard
- 1 tsp worcestershire
- 2 cloves garlic
- 3 T olive oil
- 1 tsp red wine vinegar
- 6 anchovy filets (1/2 tin)
- salt and pepper to taste
- parmesan cheese, for serving

## Instructions
In a blender, combine lemon juice, mayonnaise, mustard, worcestershire, garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, anchovies, and a heavy sprinkling of pepper. Blend until thoroughly combined and taste for salt and pepper.

To serve, toss with veggies and top with grated parmesan.
