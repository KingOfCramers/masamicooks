## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 lbs mixed mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked off stems
- 2 large shallots, sliced thinly
- 1/2 C olive oil
- 1/2 lb pasta of your choice
- 6 T butter
- 1/2 C parmesan cheese, grated plus more for topping
- parsley, chopped
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine mushrooms, thyme, shallots, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste on a large sheet pan. Toss to combine. Divide the mushroom mixture between two sheet pans and spread it in an even layer.\
\
Roast the mushrooms in the oven for a total of 25-30 minutes, taking them out halfway to rotate the pans and mix the mushrooms with a spatula to ensure they brown evenly. Once they’ve become brown and crispy, about 30 minutes, remove from the oven and set aside.\
\
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once the water has boiled, add the pasta. Cook until 2 minutes shy of the package’s directions for al dente (be sure to reserve some pasta water). While the pasta cooks, heat a large pan over medium heat.\
\
Melt the butter in the pan and add the cooked pasta with 1 cup of pasta water, grated parmesan cheese and lots of pepper. Vigorously stir and toss the pasta over medium heat until it forms a glossy sauce, about 3-4 minutes. Immediately remove from heat.\
\
To serve, divide the pasta into bowls and top with mushrooms, parsley and additional cheese if desired.\
