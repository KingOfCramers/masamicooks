I love my CSA. I really do. However, I do not love the amount of squash that I have eaten this fall as a result of my CSA. My palette is decidedly savory - I will always choose popcorn over candy, skip dessert in favor of a cheese plate, pick toast instead of granola, etc., etc., you get the point. So what's a savory gal to do with A LOT o' squash?\
\
Well, step 1 is to make lots and lots of [pumpkin bread](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/10/pumpkin-bread/), which your friends/family/neighbors will devour, and step 2 is to make this chili. By roasting the squash in advance and combining it with layers of smoky flavor, the sweetness compliments the chili rather than overpowering it (which is what I would usually think about a chili with squash in it). For all of you crazy squash lovers out there, there's still a very strong squash vibe in the chili - just not too much!

## Ingredients
- 3 T olive oil
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 3 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly,
- 3-4 poblano peppers, seeded and chopped
- 1 jalapeno, diced finely (feel free to remove seeds and membrane if sensitive to spice)
- 2 T chili powder (highly recommend getting [a fancy one](https://rawspicebar.com/products/chili-powder#undefined) if you can, quality makes all the difference with spice blends like chili powder)
- 1 large bay leaf
- 1 15-oz can diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers (Muir Glen makes a great option)
- 2 15-oz cans black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup diced roasted squash, such as butternut or delicata
- 6 oz soy chorizo crumbles or finely diced sausage (highly recommend Trader Joe's soy chorizo)
- 1/2 cup cilanto, chopped
- limes wedges, for squeezing
- salt and pepper
## Instructions
In a large dutch oven or pot, warm 2 T of the olive oil over medium heat. When shimmering, add onion, garlic, peppers, and jalapeno. Season with salt and pepper. Saute, stirring frequently, until onions begin to turn translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add chili powder and bay leaf and cook for 1-2 minutes more to wake up the flavors. Add canned tomatoes, black beans, and 1-2 cans of water depending on how thick you like your chili. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. After it boils, reduce the mixture to a simmer and cook until flavors have melded, about 45 minutes.\
\
Meanwhile, in a small saute pan, warm remaining 1 T olive oil over medium heat. Cook the chorizo in the pan, stirring as infrequently as possible until the crumbles become deeply browned and crunchy, about 10-15 minutes. The chorizo acts as a crispy topping so don't be afraid to let it get really dark - it will soften slightly when served in the chili.\
\
After 45 minutes, taste the chili for salt and pepper and adjust accordingly. Stir in cooked squash.\
\
Serve the chili in large bowls topped with crisped chorizo, cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
